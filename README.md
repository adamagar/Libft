# Libft Project

## Introduction

The `Libft` project is part of the 42 coding school curriculum, aimed at deepening the understanding of C programming by recreating standard library functions from scratch. This project serves as the foundation for future projects at 42, as it allows students to build their own library of useful functions that can be reused throughout the program.

## Project Overview

The goal of `Libft` is to recreate various standard C library functions as well as some additional ones that are not included in the libc. This includes functions for string manipulation, memory allocation, character checking and conversion, and more. By reimplementing these functions, I gained a thorough understanding of their inner workings and the nuances of programming in C.

## Functions Included

The library includes a wide range of functions from the following categories:

- **String manipulation**: Functions like `ft_strlen`, `ft_strcpy`, `ft_strdup`, and more.
- **Memory manipulation**: Functions such as `ft_memset`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_memmove`.
- **Character checks and conversions**: Functions like `ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, `ft_toupper`, `ft_tolower`.
- **Additional functions**: Including `ft_itoa`, `ft_split`, and functions to manipulate linked lists.

A complete list of functions and their descriptions can be found in the `libft.h` header file.

## How to Use

To use the `Libft` library in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adamagar/Libft.git
